    Loads all representations files from a directory, returns the names/ids and sequences as lists.

    Parameters:
        path (str): path to directory containing representations files
        names (list): list of file names in case files should be loaded in a specific order if names not None.
            Will go to provided path and load files by name order. Default None

    Returns:
